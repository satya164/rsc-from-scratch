# React Server Components from scratch

This is a very naive implementation of React Server Components. The goal is to familiarize with the concept and basic principles of Server Components.

The code in this repository is based on the [RSC from scratch](https://github.com/reactwg/server-components/discussions/5) tutorial by [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon).

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Then, start the server:

```bash
yarn start
```

The server will start on port 5172. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5172`. You should see a list of pokemon. Click on a pokemon to see its details.
